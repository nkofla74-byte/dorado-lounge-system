# Apple Design — OS Surfaces & Components

Designing native-feeling app UI across Apple's platforms, plus the standard component library.

## When to use

- Laying out an iOS/iPadOS/macOS/visionOS/watchOS screen or its chrome.
- Choosing/standardizing a component (nav bar, list style, button hierarchy, sheet, alert, empty state).

## Core rules

- **Anchor primary controls in reach** — bottom on iPhone (tab bar 49pt + safe area), and prefer the platform's native bar/sheet patterns over reinventing chrome.
- **Sheets use detents** (medium/large/custom) with a grabber; modals are for focused tasks, not navigation.
- **Match the platform's input model**: touch (44pt targets) on iOS, pointer precision + the global menu bar on macOS, gaze (60pt targets) + eye/pinch on visionOS, Digital Crown + glanceability on watchOS.
- **Use the documented button hierarchy** (`borderedProminent` → `bordered` → `borderless`) and the right list style (plain / grouped / insetGrouped); always design **empty states** (`ContentUnavailableView`).
- iOS 26 / macOS Tahoe restyle controls in **Liquid Glass** (floating, translucent) — see apple-design-materials.

## Common mistakes

- Top-only controls out of thumb reach; faking native chrome with wrong metrics.
- Touch-sized targets on a pointer OS (or vice-versa); modal overuse; missing empty states.
- Tiny gaze targets / motion-sickness triggers in visionOS; dense watch faces.
