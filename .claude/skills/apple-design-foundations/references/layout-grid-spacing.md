# Apple Layout, Grid & Spacing Systems

Scope: the 8pt spacing system, iOS safe areas, native app margins, apple.com's web grid, and the bento layout trend — with exact values, copy-paste code, and confidence labels on every non-trivial claim.

---

## Principles

### Rhythm as deference

Apple's layout system exists to keep the interface quiet so content speaks. Every spacing decision is a rhythm decision: consistent increments let the eye move without friction. The 8pt unit is not arbitrary — it is the smallest step that survives the three pixel-density tiers Apple ships (1x on older devices, 2x on iPhone/iPad, 3x on Pro models) without sub-pixel blur [documented]. An 8pt gap becomes 8 px at 1x, 16 px at 2x, 24 px at 3x — always an integer [documented]. A 5pt gap produces 7.5 px at 1.5x density, which the display anti-aliases into visible blur [documented].

### Density as a trust signal

Apple uses negative space to signal premium quality. The canonical example: the original iPhone home screen had 4×4 icons with generous margins when every competitor tried to fit more. More whitespace = more confidence. Tight spacing suggests insecurity about the content [inferred from product history]. This is why Apple's bento boxes use generous interior padding even when individual tiles are small.

### The grid as a deference tool

A strict grid reduces the "decision surface" for every layout choice. Fewer arbitrary values means fewer visual arguments between elements, faster developer implementation, and better cross-device consistency [documented via 8pt grid analyses]. Apple's native layouts use the grid not as a rigid cage but as a negotiating partner — elements may fall between grid lines when optical correction demands it, but departures are deliberate and rare.

### Safe areas as a contract

Starting with iPhone X (2017), Apple formalized the concept of safe areas: regions of screen guaranteed to be visible and not obscured by hardware features. This codified what had always been implicit (status bar avoidance) into a first-class API. The contract: system draws its chrome, your app draws inside the safe area, the seam is invisible [documented]. iOS 26 / Liquid Glass extends this principle — materials blur into the system chrome rather than fighting it.

## Apple Specifics

### The 8pt spacing system

**Base unit:** 8pt  
**Half-step:** 4pt (for icon-to-label, tight inline gaps)  
**Quarter-step:** 2pt (rare; optical corrections only)

Standard spacing scale [documented from HIG analyses + design community sources]:

| Token        | Value | Use                                            |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `space-2xs`  | 2pt   | Hairline gap; optical only                     |
| `space-xs`   | 4pt   | Icon-to-label, badge offsets                   |
| `space-sm`   | 8pt   | Between related inline elements                |
| `space-md`   | 12pt  | Between sibling list rows (soft 8pt variant)   |
| `space-base` | 16pt  | Standard side margin (phones); form field gaps |
| `space-lg`   | 24pt  | Between content blocks; card interior padding  |
| `space-xl`   | 32pt  | Between major sections (phone)                 |
| `space-2xl`  | 40pt  | Component padding on large components          |
| `space-3xl`  | 48pt  | Section spacing on iPad                        |
| `space-4xl`  | 64pt  | Hero/banner breathing room                     |

The 12pt value (`space-md`) is technically "off-grid" but is widely used in Apple's own UIKit list row implementation; think of it as the "soft grid" allowance for readability [inferred from iOS UIKit defaults].

### iOS layout margins

**Phone portrait side margin:** 16pt [documented]  
**iPad side margin:** 20pt minimum; scales with size class [documented]  
**Readable content guide width (iPad landscape):** ~672pt [observed via UIKit measurement]  
**Readable content guide character target:** ~87 characters per line [documented]  
**Max readable content width (smallest Dynamic Type):** ~560pt [documented]  
**Max readable content width (largest standard Dynamic Type):** ~896pt [documented]

The readable content guide (`readableContentGuide`) never exceeds the view's layout margin guide. On iPhone, it equals the layout margin guide; on iPad, it shrinks the line length to prevent lines so long the reader loses their place [documented].

### Minimum tap targets

**Minimum interactive area:** 44×44pt [documented — Apple HIG, explicit]  
**Recommended comfortable target:** 48×48pt or larger [inferred from Android Material crossover + accessibility guidelines]  
**Exception:** toolbar/navigation bar items may use visual sizes smaller than 44pt IF the hit area is padded to 44pt [documented]

> The 44pt rule is Apple's hardest layout constraint. Break it and both App Store review and accessibility audits will flag it.

### Component height standards [documented from HIG/UIKit defaults]

| Component             | Height                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Navigation bar        | 44pt (plus status bar / safe area top) |
| Tab bar               | 49pt (plus home indicator safe area)   |
| Standard list cell    | 44pt minimum                           |
| Subtitle list cell    | 60pt                                   |
| Search bar            | 36pt (within a navigation bar context) |
| Toolbar               | 44pt                                   |
| SF Symbol inline icon | 22pt (single-weight medium)            |

### Safe area insets — device reference table

All values in points (pt). Portrait orientation. [observed via useyourloaf.com measurements]

| Device                             | Screen (pt)        | Scale   | Safe-top | Safe-bottom |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| iPhone SE (2nd/3rd gen)            | 375×667 / 390×844  | 2x / 3x | 20       | 0 / 34      |
| iPhone 14 (notch)                  | 390×844            | 3x      | 47       | 34          |
| iPhone 14 Plus (notch)             | 428×926            | 3x      | 47       | 34          |
| iPhone 14 Pro (Dynamic Island)     | 393×852            | 3x      | 59       | 34          |
| iPhone 14 Pro Max (Dynamic Island) | 430×932            | 3x      | 59       | 34          |
| iPhone 15 / 15 Plus                | 393×852 / 430×932  | 3x      | 59       | 34          |
| iPhone 15 Pro / Pro Max            | same as 15/15 Plus | 3x      | 59       | 34          |
| iPhone 16 / 16 Plus                | 393×852 / 430×932  | 3x      | 59       | 34          |
| iPhone 16 Pro                      | 402×874            | 3x      | 62       | 34          |
| iPhone 16 Pro Max                  | 440×956            | 3x      | 62       | 34          |
| iPhone 17 / 17 Pro                 | 402×874            | 3x      | 62       | 34          |
| iPhone 17 Pro Max                  | 440×956            | 3x      | 62       | 34          |
| iPhone Air (2025)                  | 420×912            | 3x      | 68       | 34          |

Landscape safe areas (all Dynamic Island devices, portrait→landscape): top=0 or 20, bottom=21 or 29, left/right= the portrait top value [observed]. The iPhone Air introduces top=68pt, the tallest top inset yet, due to its ultra-thin bezel camera placement [observed].

**Home indicator bottom inset:** 34pt on all face-ID / Dynamic Island devices in portrait; 21pt in landscape [observed]. Devices with physical Home button: 0pt (no inset needed) [documented].

### apple.com web grid — historical + current

Apple's public website has used a **980px centered max-width content column** as its primary container for over a decade [documented from 2016 case study analysis]. This is the same 980px that was the original iPhone viewport target width.

Primary breakpoints observed and documented by web analysts:

| Breakpoint | Layout shift                                                                                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 320px    | Not explicitly supported                                                                                 |
| 320px      | Mobile baseline; 1-col, 16px edge margins                                                                |
| 768px      | Tablet; 2-col layouts activate                                                                           |
| ~1069px    | Desktop lock; content area fixed at 980px                                                                |
| ~1200px+   | Wide desktop; some newer pages expand to ~1200px or use full-width sections with capped inner containers |

[documented from 2016 IA case study; the 980px figure is stable across 10+ years of observation; wider breakpoints are inferred from 2024 product pages that appear to use ~1200px containers]

**Column system:** Historically 4-column at desktop, 2-column at tablet, 1-column at mobile [documented]. Modern product pages use a looser system with asymmetric sections rather than strict column counts [observed by visual inspection of product pages].

**Gutter / margins:** 16px at mobile, ~22px at tablet, scaling above that [documented]. The `--container-margin` equivalent maps cleanly to the 8pt system in web pixels.

**Section vertical rhythm on product pages:** Sections alternate between ~60px and ~100px top padding depending on whether they use a full-bleed photo background or a white/gray card background [inferred from visual analysis of iPhone product pages; not observed via devtools directly].

**Apple gray palette for web:** `#f5f5f7` (light section bg), `#ffffff` (card bg), `#1d1d1f` (primary text), `#6e6e73` (secondary text) [observed repeatedly in recreations and analyses].

### Apple's bento grid — product page usage

Apple popularized the bento grid layout with the iPhone 14 Pro product page in late 2022 and continued it through iPhone 15, 16, iPad Pro, Mac, and Vision Pro pages [documented].

**Canonical Apple bento structure:**

- **Grid:** typically 4-column or 3-column base [inferred from reverse-engineering analyses]
- **Gap between tiles:** 6–16px; one close reverse-engineering source cites 6px exactly; community recreations typically use 16px [inferred; 6px value from one source, observed structural gap from recreations is 12–16px]
- **Tile border-radius:** 18px [observed in iPhone 14 landing page recreation with 980px container]
- **Container width:** 980px [observed in recreation; consistent with the historical max-width]
- **Tile interior padding:** 24–32px [inferred from visual analysis]
- **Row height:** 336px for the iPhone 14 grid [observed in recreation]
- **Hero tile occupancy:** 40–50% of the total grid area [documented from bento analysis]
- **Cell count per section:** 6–9 tiles is the sweet spot [documented]
- **Design rule:** every grid cell must be occupied — no orphan cells [documented]

Tile size vocabulary Apple uses [inferred from product pages]:

- **1×1** — small feature (single spec, single icon stat)
- **2×1** — wide feature (landscape photo + label)
- **1×2** — tall feature (portrait photo)
- **2×2** — hero tile (main camera, main chip comparison)

## Adaptive Layout Decision Logic

This section covers the _functional_ layer: **when** a layout changes, **why** it changes, and **how to code** the decision. It does not duplicate the grid values above.

---

### Size Classes & Adaptive Decisions

Apple's adaptive layout system is built on **available space**, not on named device types. The key mental model: never write `if iPad` — write `if horizontalSizeClass == .regular` [documented — Apple HIG, "Adapting to size classes"].

#### The two size class axes

| Axis       | `.compact`                       | `.regular`   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Horizontal | Limited width (tight)            | Ample width  |
| Vertical   | Limited height (landscape phone) | Ample height |

Apple collapses four possible combinations into one signal: **horizontal size class** is the dominant layout trigger for navigation and column decisions. Vertical size class matters mainly for deciding whether to stack controls (e.g., in-call banners on landscape iPhone) [documented].

#### Device → size class mapping [documented — useyourloaf.com, Apple WWDC 2015 reference]

| Context                                              | Horiz   | Vert    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| iPhone portrait (all models)                         | compact | regular |
| iPhone landscape (standard models)                   | compact | compact |
| iPhone landscape (Plus/Max models)                   | regular | compact |
| iPad full-screen (any size, any orientation)         | regular | regular |
| iPad Slide Over                                      | compact | regular |
| iPad Split View 1/3 (portrait or landscape)          | compact | regular |
| iPad Split View 2/3 landscape (standard iPad)        | compact | regular |
| iPad Split View 2/3 landscape (iPad Pro 12.9″ 50/50) | regular | regular |
| Mac Catalyst                                         | regular | regular |

> The critical insight: **iPad apps in Split View can drop to compact horizontal**. An app cannot assume it always has regular width just because it is running on an iPad. Always read the trait collection dynamically [documented].

#### The HStack → VStack reflow rule

The canonical Apple pattern: use **HStack when `horizontalSizeClass == .regular`**, VStack when compact. This mirrors how every Apple first-party app reflows — Mail shows a two-pane master/detail (regular) or a full-screen list (compact); Settings shows a sidebar+detail (regular) or a stacked list (compact) [observed — iOS Mail, Settings, Notes].

#### Sidebar vs. tab bar — the convergence rule [documented — Apple HIG Navigation, WWDC25 session 208]

| Condition                            | Navigation pattern                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Regular width + sufficient depth     | Sidebar                            |
| Compact width (iPhone portrait, any) | Tab bar                            |
| iPad portrait / narrow Split View    | Tab bar (sidebar can morph back)   |
| iPad landscape full-screen           | Sidebar preferred for complex apps |
| Mac (via Mac Catalyst)               | Sidebar (required for convergence) |

Apple's rule is: **a sidebar and a tab bar are the same navigation model at different widths**. Build the sidebar first, then let it morph into a tab bar when width collapses. The reverse (building only a tab bar) makes Mac Catalyst convergence hard [documented — WWDC25 "Elevate the design of your iPad app"].

#### Multi-column collapse rule

| Available width                 | Column count                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular (iPad full-screen, Mac) | 2–3 columns (sidebar + content + optional inspector) |
| iPad Split View compact         | 1 column (push navigation only)                      |
| iPhone portrait                 | 1 column                                             |
| iPhone landscape Plus/Max       | 2 columns acceptable                                 |

Rule: **never leave a column empty** — if a column would have nothing in it at the current width, collapse to fewer columns. Empty columns read as broken layouts [inferred from Apple first-party app behavior].

---

### Content-Driven (Not Device-Driven) Breakpoints

Apple's web grid has historically used device-named breakpoints (320 / 768 / 1068), but the underlying principle is content-driven: **break where the content needs it, not where a device exists** [documented — responsive design practice; Apple's own 980px max-width is itself a content-width decision].

#### The readable measure as a breakpoint driver

The typographic measure (line length) is the most reliable content-driven breakpoint trigger. Industry consensus, codified in Robert Bringhurst's _The Elements of Typographic Style_ and applied in Apple's `readableContentGuide`:

- **Optimal single-column measure:** 45–75 characters per line [documented]
- **Absolute maximum before comprehension drops:** ~87 characters (Apple's `readableContentGuide` target) [documented — Apple HIG, UIKit `readableContentGuide`]
- **CSS unit:** `ch` — width of the `0` glyph in the current font; `66ch` ≈ 66 characters regardless of font size [documented — CSS specification]

**Decision rule:** when a text block would exceed ~75ch without a breakpoint, that is where the breakpoint belongs — not at 768px because a tablet starts there.

```css
/* Content-width breakpoint driven by measure, not device */
.prose {
  max-width: 66ch; /* ~66 chars — single-column sweet spot */
  margin-inline: auto;
}

/* Wider container for two-column layout when content supports it */
.prose-wide {
  max-width: min(75ch, 100%); /* never exceed 75ch even at wide viewports */
}
```

---

### Fluid Systems: `clamp()` for Type and Space

**When fluid beats stepped breakpoints:** large display text, spacing tokens that must scale smoothly between mobile and desktop, any value with a substantial min↔max range and no meaning attached to specific intermediate values [documented — Smashing Magazine, "Modern Fluid Typography Using CSS Clamp"].

**When discrete breakpoints are still right:** body text where the size difference is small (16px → 18px); layout structure that must snap (one column → two columns is not a smooth continuum); components where precise pixel control matters at specific widths [documented — same source].

#### The `clamp()` formula

```
font-size: clamp([min]rem, [slope]vw + [intercept]rem, [max]rem);
```

Derivation from two design targets _(y₁ at viewport x₁) and (y₂ at viewport x₂)_:

```
slope     = 100 × (y₂ − y₁) / (x₂ − x₁)   → the vw coefficient
intercept = (x₁ × y₂ − x₂ × y₁) / (x₁ − x₂) → the rem offset (divide by 16 for rem)
```

**Worked example:** heading that is 30px at 375px viewport and 56px at 1200px viewport:

```
slope     = 100 × (56 − 30) / (1200 − 375) = 3.15vw
intercept = (375 × 56 − 1200 × 30) / (375 − 1200) = 18.18px ≈ 1.136rem
```

Result: `clamp(1.875rem, 3.15vw + 1.136rem, 3.5rem)`

#### Fluid type + space token system [documented — Smashing Magazine; clampgenerator.com]

```css
:root {
  /* ── Fluid type scale (375px → 1200px) ──────────────────────────── */
  /* Each clamp: (min-size-rem, slope-vw + intercept-rem, max-size-rem) */

  /* Display / hero */
  --text-display: clamp(2.25rem, 3.15vw + 1.14rem, 3.5rem); /* 36→56px */
  --text-title-1: clamp(1.75rem, 2.42vw + 0.84rem, 2.75rem); /* 28→44px */
  --text-title-2: clamp(1.375rem, 1.82vw + 0.69rem, 2rem); /* 22→32px */
  --text-headline: clamp(1.125rem, 0.97vw + 0.76rem, 1.5rem); /* 18→24px */
  --text-body: clamp(1rem, 0.48vw + 0.82rem, 1.125rem); /* 16→18px */
  --text-caption: clamp(0.8125rem, 0.3vw + 0.7rem, 0.9375rem); /* 13→15px */

  /* ── Fluid space scale (375px → 1200px) ─────────────────────────── */
  /* Pairs with the 8pt grid tokens; fluid where section rhythm matters */
  --space-fluid-sm: clamp(0.75rem, 1.21vw + 0.3rem, 1.5rem); /* 12→24px */
  --space-fluid-md: clamp(1rem, 1.94vw + 0.27rem, 2rem); /* 16→32px */
  --space-fluid-lg: clamp(1.5rem, 2.91vw + 0.41rem, 3rem); /* 24→48px */
  --space-fluid-xl: clamp(2rem, 3.88vw + 0.55rem, 4rem); /* 32→64px */
  --space-fluid-2xl: clamp(2.5rem, 4.85vw + 0.68rem, 5rem); /* 40→80px */
  --space-fluid-3xl: clamp(3rem, 5.82vw + 0.82rem, 6.25rem); /* 48→100px */
}
```

> **Accessibility note:** mixing `vw` inside `clamp()` can prevent text zoom from reaching 200% (WCAG 1.4.4). Keep min/max in `rem` (not `px`) so user font-size preferences still scale the bounds. Test with browser zoom always [documented — Smashing Magazine accessibility caveat].

### Container Queries: Component-Level Responsiveness

A **container query** fires based on the size of a parent element; a **media query** fires based on the viewport. This is not a stylistic preference — it is an architectural decision about what unit of context is meaningful [documented — MDN, "CSS container queries"].

#### When to use container queries vs. media queries

| Use case                                                                 | Tool                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Page-level layout (1 col → 2 col → sidebar)                              | Media query                          |
| OS-level preferences (dark mode, reduced motion, contrast)               | Media query                          |
| A card component that can appear in a 300px sidebar OR a 900px main area | Container query                      |
| A navigation bar that wraps when its container is narrow                 | Container query                      |
| A reusable design-system component with unknown placement context        | Container query                      |
| Breakpoints locked to known device widths                                | Media query (or neither — use fluid) |

**The core decision rule:** if you know the component will always be full-width, a media query works fine. If the component could live in a narrow sidebar, a grid cell, or a full-width slot — and needs different layout in each — use a container query [documented — freeCodeCamp, MDN].

#### CSS container query syntax [documented — MDN]

```css
/* ── Step 1: declare the containment context on the PARENT ── */
.card-grid {
  container-type: inline-size; /* query available inline (horizontal) space */
  container-name: card-grid; /* optional — enables named @container rules */
}

/* Shorthand */
.card-grid {
  container: card-grid / inline-size;
}

/* ── Step 2: style the child based on container size ── */
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* default: stacked (narrow context) */

}

@container card-grid (width > 480px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: row; /* side-by-side when container is wide enough */
    align-items: center;
  }

  .card__image {
    width: 160px;
    flex-shrink: 0;
  }
}

@container card-grid (width > 720px) {

  }
}
```

#### Hybrid pattern: media query for page structure, container query for components [documented — MDN, freeCodeCamp]

```css
/* Page structure: media query sets the column count */
@media (width >= 768px) {
  .page-layout {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 240px 1fr;
  }
}

/* Component: container query handles its own reflow regardless of column */
.sidebar {
  container: sidebar-ctx / inline-size;
}
.main-area {
  container: main-area-ctx / inline-size;
}

@container sidebar-ctx (width < 200px) {
  .nav-item span {
    display: none;
  } /* icon-only when sidebar is narrow */
}

@container main-area-ctx (width >= 600px) {
  .feature-card {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

### Density: Regular vs. Compact Information Density

Apple's density decisions are **platform-driven** (Mac/iPad-style input = more density) and **context-driven** (inspector panels and toolbars = higher density; reading surfaces = lower density). [documented — Apple HIG; WWDC25 session "Get to know the new design system"]

#### Density by platform

| Platform / context                 | Density posture                                   | Rationale                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| iPhone (touch-primary)             | Low — generous targets, large text                | Finger imprecision                        |
| iPad (touch + Pencil)              | Medium — slightly denser than iPhone              | Larger canvas + Pencil precision          |
| iPad with pointer (Magic Keyboard) | Higher — Mac-like inspector panels acceptable     | Pointer precision matches Mac             |
| Mac (cursor-primary)               | High — compact controls, mini/small variants used | Cursor precision; no touch-target minimum |
| visionOS                           | Low — very generous targets                       | Imprecise eye/hand tracking               |

#### What changes with higher density [documented — Apple HIG; WWDC25 macOS controls session]

- **Control size:** macOS mini/small rounded-rect controls used in inspector panels, toolbars, sidebars; iOS always uses full-size controls.
- **Row height:** macOS list rows can be 24–28pt; iOS list rows are 44pt minimum.
- **Sidebar width:** macOS sidebar narrows to ~220pt; iPadOS sidebar is wider (~320pt) for touch.
- **Icon size:** macOS toolbar icons at 16pt; iOS at 22pt SF Symbol medium.
- **Padding:** macOS cell padding at 4–8pt; iOS at 12–16pt.

#### Density decision rule

> Increase density only when the user has a pointing device with sub-pixel precision. Never increase density on touch-primary surfaces — a compact Mac-style inspector on an iPhone is an accessibility failure [documented — Apple HIG tap target rule].

On iPad, Apple uses **size class** as the proxy for density: regular width + keyboard/pointer attached → offer higher-density layout; compact width or touch-only → revert to generous spacing. This is why `UITraitCollection.userInterfaceIdiom` is deprecated in favor of size class + pointer input detection [documented — Apple WWDC 2019 "Designing iPad Apps for Mac"].

### Adaptive Layout Decision Table

| Trigger condition                                      | Decision                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `horizontalSizeClass == .compact`                      | VStack / single column / tab bar                    |
| `horizontalSizeClass == .regular`                      | HStack / multi-column / sidebar                     |
| Container width < 480px                                | Stack cards vertically; hide secondary metadata     |
| Container width ≥ 480px                                | Side-by-side card layout; show metadata             |
| Line length > 75ch                                     | Add breakpoint / column; constrain with `max-width` |
| Content fits in HStack at current width                | `ViewThatFits` picks HStack automatically           |
| Content overflows HStack                               | `ViewThatFits` falls back to VStack                 |
| Touch-only surface                                     | Min 44pt targets; generous spacing; low density     |
| Pointer/keyboard attached (iPad/Mac)                   | May increase density; smaller controls acceptable   |
| Value has large min↔max range, no intermediate meaning | `clamp()` fluid                                     |
| Layout must snap (1 col → 2 col)                       | Discrete media/container query breakpoint           |
| Component appears in multiple layout contexts          | Container query over media query                    |
| Page-level structure decision                          | Media query                                         |
| Dark mode / reduced motion / contrast preference       | Media query (`prefers-*`)                           |
| iPadOS Slide Over / narrow Split View                  | Treat as compact (same code path as iPhone)         |
| iPad Pro 12.9″ 50/50 Split View landscape              | Can be regular; verify at runtime                   |

## Recipes

> **Recipes 0a–0d** are the new adaptive/responsive logic recipes added in the layout-decision-logic pass. Existing recipes are renumbered from 1 onward — they are unchanged.

### 0a. SwiftUI adaptive stack: size class + AnyLayout + ViewThatFits

Three patterns in increasing sophistication. Use the simplest that fits. [documented — Swift by Sundell; Hacking with Swift; useyourloaf.com]

```swift
import SwiftUI

// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Pattern 1 (iOS 14+): @Environment size class — explicit branch
// Best when the two layouts are structurally very different.
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
struct AdaptiveView_SizeClass: View {
    @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) private var hSizeClass

    var body: some View {
        if hSizeClass == .regular {
            // iPad full-screen / Mac / iPhone landscape Plus — side-by-side
            HStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 24) {
                PrimaryContent()
                SecondaryContent()
            }
            .padding(.horizontal, 32)
        } else {
            // iPhone portrait / iPad in Slide Over — stacked
            VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 16) {
                PrimaryContent()
                SecondaryContent()
            }
            .padding(.horizontal, 16)
        }
    }
}

// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Pattern 2 (iOS 16+): AnyLayout — identity-preserving animated transition
// Best when child views have state (e.g. animations, scroll position) that must
// survive the layout switch.  AnyLayout preserves view identity; an if/else does not.
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
struct DynamicStack<Content: View>: View {
    var hAlignment: HorizontalAlignment = .center
    var vAlignment: VerticalAlignment   = .center
    var spacing: CGFloat?
    @ViewBuilder var content: () -> Content

    @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) private var hSizeClass

    // Choosing the layout type is a pure value; no branching in body needed.
    private var layout: AnyLayout {
        hSizeClass == .regular
            ? AnyLayout(HStack(alignment: vAlignment, spacing: spacing))
            : AnyLayout(VStack(alignment: hAlignment, spacing: spacing))
    }

    var body: some View {
        layout(content)
            // Animate layout transition on size-class change (rotation / Split View resize)
            .animation(.spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.8), value: hSizeClass)
    }
}

// Usage
struct LoginActions: View {
    var body: some View {
        DynamicStack(spacing: 12) {
            Button("Log in")      { }
            Button("Sign up")     { }
            Button("Forgot password") { }
        }
        .buttonStyle(.bordered)
    }
}

// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Pattern 3 (iOS 16+): ViewThatFits — content-driven, no size class needed
// Best when the reflow decision should come from WHETHER the content actually fits,
// not from a named size class.  Works correctly in Split View, Slide Over, and
// any future display size without changes.
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
struct TimerControl: View {
    let timecode: String

    var body: some View {
        // SwiftUI tries WideLayout first; if it overflows .horizontal, uses NarrowLayout.
        ViewThatFits(in: .horizontal) {
            WideLayout(timecode: timecode)
            NarrowLayout(timecode: timecode)
        }
    }
}

private struct WideLayout: View {
    let timecode: String
    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 16) {
            DecrementButton()
            TimerDisplay(timecode: timecode)
            IncrementButton()
            ResetButton()
        }
    }
}

private struct NarrowLayout: View {
    let timecode: String
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 8) {
            TimerDisplay(timecode: timecode)
            HStack(spacing: 12) {
                DecrementButton()
                ResetButton()
                IncrementButton()
            }
        }
    }
}

// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Sidebar vs. tab bar — NavigationSplitView + NavigationStack convergence
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
struct RootNavigation: View {
    @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) private var hSizeClass

    var body: some View {
        // NavigationSplitView automatically shows sidebar on regular,
        // collapses to push-stack on compact — this is the canonical Apple pattern.
        NavigationSplitView {
            SidebarList()
        } detail: {
            DetailView()
        }
        // On compact (iPhone / Slide Over), SwiftUI renders this as a NavigationStack.
        // No manual if/else needed for the split-vs-stack decision.
    }
}
```

### 0b. CSS container queries — component-level reflow recipe

[documented — MDN Web Docs; freeCodeCamp]

```css
/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```

### 3. Apple-style bento CSS grid

```css
/* --- Bento grid: Apple product-page pattern --- */
.bento-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 336px; /* matches iPhone 14 LP recreation */
  gap: 16px; /* community standard; 6px for zero-gap look */
  max-width: 980px;
  margin-inline: auto;
  padding-inline: var(--space-base);
}

.bento-card {
  background: var(--apple-bg-light);
  border-radius: var(--apple-radius-md); /* 18px */
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: var(--space-lg); /* 24px interior */

### 4. Bento grid — exact proportions (recipe)

The existing recipe (Recipe 3) gives the structural skeleton. This section fills in the column proportions and responsive breakpoints that agents had to guess previously.

**Why `repeat(4, 1fr)` is correct for Apple's canonical bento** [observed — iPhone 14 and 15 landing page recreations; cross-confirmed by community analyses]:

Apple's desktop bento sections are almost universally built on a **4-equal-column base**. The hero occupies `col span 2 / row span 2`; a secondary wide tile occupies `col span 2 / row span 1`; tall accent tiles occupy `col span 1 / row span 2`; square fillers occupy `col span 1 / row span 1`. The columns are equal (`1fr` each) — Apple does **not** use asymmetric column ratios in the tile grid itself. The visual weight hierarchy comes from `span` counts, not from unequal column widths [observed].

**Common 6-tile layout (the iPhone 14 Pro / 15 Pro bento blueprint)** [observed from recreation analysis]:

```
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|               |       |       |
|   HERO 2×2    |  sq   |  sq   |  row 1
|               +-------+-------+
|               |       WIDE 2×1|  row 2
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
```

This is: 1 hero (col 1–2, row 1–2) + 2 squares (col 3, col 4, row 1) + 1 wide (col 3–4, row 2). Total: 6 cells, zero orphans. [documented pattern — zero-orphan rule]

**Alternate 9-tile layout (Mac / iPad Pro sections):**

```
+---+---+---+---+
| W I D E  2×1  |  row 1
+---+---+---+---+
|   | T | T |   |
|sq | A | A |sq |  rows 2–3
|   | L | L |   |
+---+---+---+---+
|   WIDE   2×1  |  row 4 (or 4 squares)
+---+---+---+---+
```

  overflow: hidden;
}

  border-radius: 0; /* tiles are borderless inside the clipped wrapper */
}
```

**Confidence notes:**

- `repeat(4, 1fr)` equal columns: [observed] — all credible recreations use this; no source uses asymmetric ratios
- `grid-auto-rows: 336px`: [observed — Jon Lehman iPhone 14 LP recreation]
- `gap: 16px` community standard / `6px` tight variant: [inferred — one source cites 6px; 16px is the dominant community recreation value]
- Tablet/mobile breakpoints: [inferred from Apple's general responsive patterns; not directly measured on apple.com bento sections]

### 5. Glass bento tile

A bento tile that is itself a dark Liquid-Glass panel (rather than the standard light `#f5f5f7` fill) over a gradient or image backdrop. This composes the bento structure from Recipe 3/4 with the glass material from `apple-design-materials` — **do not duplicate the glass values here; cross-reference that file for blur/saturate/opacity parameters.**

**When to use:** Dark/pro sections — e.g., a "Chip performance" tile on a black-background bento row, or any tile where the content behind the glass needs to show through.

```css
/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Glass bento tile
   Requires the dark Liquid-Glass values from apple-design-materials.
   The tile itself is position:relative; the glass layer is a
   pseudo-element so content renders above it.
   [inferred — composed from bento structure + materials reference]
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/* 1. The tile has a transparent or near-transparent base so the
      backdrop (gradient / photo / dark section bg) shows through */
.bento-card--glass {
  position: relative;
  background: transparent; /* backdrop visible through the glass fill */
  border-radius: var(--apple-radius-md); /* 18px — matches standard bento tiles */
  overflow: hidden;

  /* Ensure content stacks above the glass pseudo-layer */
  isolation: isolate;
}

/* 2. Glass fill as a pseudo-element — sits between backdrop and content */
.bento-card--glass::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  border-radius: inherit;

  /* ── Glass fill — see apple-design-materials for canonical values ──
     Dark Liquid Glass recipe:
     background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)  → subtle white veil
     backdrop-filter: blur(40px) saturate(180%)
     -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(40px) saturate(180%)
     border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)  → specular rim

     Light Glass recipe:
     background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.55)
     backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(160%)
     border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.45)

     Use the values that match your modal; defaults below are dark-glass: */
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
  backdrop-filter: blur(40px) saturate(180%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(40px) saturate(180%);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12);

  /* Pointer events pass through to content layer */
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 0;
}

/* 3. Content layer — sits above the glass pseudo-element */
.bento-card--glass .bento-content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;

  /* Text anchored to bottom (standard Apple bento pattern) */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  height: 100%;
  padding: var(--space-lg); /* 24px */
}

/* 4. Text treatment on dark glass tiles — always light text */
.bento-card--glass .bento-headline {
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 21px;
  font-weight: 600;
  line-height: 1.3;
  /* Tight tracking at display sizes (Apple convention) [documented] */
  letter-spacing: -0.01em;
}

.bento-card--glass .bento-label {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65); /* secondary on dark glass */
  font-size: 15px;
  font-weight: 400;
  margin-top: 4px;
}
```

**HTML pattern:**

```html
<!-- Glass bento tile — hero size, dark section -->
<div class="bento-card bento-card--hero bento-card--glass">
  <!-- Optional: media behind the glass -->
  <img
    src="chip-backdrop.jpg"
    alt=""
    style="position:absolute;inset:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;z-index:-1;"
  />

  <div class="bento-content">
    <p class="bento-headline">A18 Pro chip.</p>
    <p class="bento-label">The fastest chip ever in a smartphone.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Key pattern notes:**

- The `::before` pseudo-element approach keeps the backdrop-filter scoped to the glass fill layer, avoiding the common bug where `backdrop-filter` on the parent clips its own content [documented — known CSS backdrop-filter scoping behavior].
- `isolation: isolate` on the tile prevents the glass filter from bleeding into sibling tiles [documented — CSS stacking context].
- Do **not** add `box-shadow` to a glass tile on top of a dark section — the specular border (1px rgba white) already defines the edge. Box-shadow on dark glass creates a muddy halo [inferred from Apple's material approach].
- For the glass values (blur radius, saturation, background opacity), always defer to `apple-design-materials` — those values are version-controlled there. The values above are a reasonable default as of 2025 but may drift.

### 6. Safe-area CSS `env()` insets

```css
/* --- Safe area handling for web/PWA --- */

/* Bottom-anchored nav (tab bar equivalent) */
.tab-bar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: calc(49px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom)); /* 49pt + home indicator */
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
}

/* Content that should not hide behind the status bar / Dynamic Island */
.page-content {
  padding-top: max(20px, env(safe-area-inset-top));
  padding-bottom: max(34px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
  padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);
  padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right);
}

/* Full-bleed image that should extend into status bar area */
.hero-image {
  /* extends behind but keep text clear */
  margin-top: calc(-1 * env(safe-area-inset-top));
}

/* Viewport meta required for env() to work */
/* <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover"> */
```

> `viewport-fit=cover` is required for `env(safe-area-inset-*)` to return non-zero values. Without it, the browser keeps content in the legacy safe area automatically, and `env()` returns 0.

### 7. SwiftUI layout spacing

```swift
// --- Spacing tokens in SwiftUI ---
extension CGFloat {
    static let spaceXS:   CGFloat = 4
    static let spaceSM:   CGFloat = 8
    static let spaceMD:   CGFloat = 12   // soft step
    static let spaceBase: CGFloat = 16
    static let spaceLG:   CGFloat = 24
    static let spaceXL:   CGFloat = 32
    static let space2XL:  CGFloat = 48
    static let space3XL:  CGFloat = 64
}

// Standard list cell (44pt minimum tap target)
struct StandardCell: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: .spaceSM) {          // 8pt between icon and label
            Image(systemName: "star.fill")
                .frame(width: 44, height: 44) // full tap target
            Text("Label")
                .font(.body)
            Spacer()
        }
        .padding(.horizontal, .spaceBase)    // 16pt edge margin
        .frame(minHeight: 44)                // 44pt minimum row height
    }
}

// Safe-area-aware scrollable content
struct SafeAwareView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack(spacing: .spaceLG) {      // 24pt between blocks
                // content
            }
            .padding(.horizontal, .spaceBase)
        }
        // Extend background behind safe areas, keep content inside
        .ignoresSafeArea(edges: .top)
        .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom, spacing: 0) {
            // custom tab bar or bottom content
            Color.clear.frame(height: 49)    // 49pt tab bar equivalent
        }
    }
}

// Bento card in SwiftUI (LazyVGrid)
struct BentoSection: View {
    let columns = [GridItem(.flexible()), GridItem(.flexible())]

    var body: some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: columns, spacing: .spaceBase) { // 16pt gap
            BentoCard(size: .hero)                         // span via explicit sizing
            BentoCard(size: .standard)
            BentoCard(size: .standard)
            BentoCard(size: .wide)
        }
        .padding(.horizontal, .spaceBase)
    }
}
```

## Faithful Replication

### Replicating apple.com's grid rhythm

The pattern to internalize: Apple's desktop product pages have a **980px centered column** with **16–22px horizontal edge padding**, **80–100px vertical section separation**, and sections alternate between `#f5f5f7` (light gray) and `#ffffff` (white) backgrounds to create rhythm without using borders or dividers [observed + inferred].

To replicate:

1. Set `max-width: 980px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 16px` on every content wrapper.
2. Give every `<section>` `padding: 80px 0` minimum.
3. Alternate section backgrounds between `#f5f5f7` and `#ffffff`.
4. Typography: body copy at ~17–18px, SF Pro / system-ui, line-height 1.5.
5. Headlines: large display type at 48–64px on desktop, dropping to 28–40px on mobile.

```css
/* Faithful apple.com page shell */
body {
  font-family: -apple-system, 'SF Pro Text', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 17px;
  line-height: 1.47; /* matches SF Pro body rhythm */
  color: #1d1d1f;
  background: #ffffff;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

.page-section {
  padding: 80px 0;
}

.page-section:nth-child(even) {
  background: #f5f5f7;
}

.inner {
  max-width: 980px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 22px;
}

@media (max-width: 1068px) {
  .inner {
    padding: 0 16px;
  }
  .page-section {
    padding: 60px 0;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .inner {
    padding: 0 16px;
  }
  .page-section {
    padding: 40px 0;
  }
}
```

### Building a credible bento section

A credible Apple-style bento section follows this content hierarchy before assigning grid areas: identify the hero claim (2×2), the secondary feature (2×1), then fill remaining cells with 1×1 stats or callouts. Every cell must be occupied [documented].

```html
<!-- Apple-style 4-col bento with 6 tiles -->
<section class="page-section">
  <div class="inner">
    <h2 class="section-eyebrow">Designed for everything you do.</h2>
    <div class="bento-grid">
      <div class="bento-card bento-card--hero bg-dark">
        <img src="hero-feature.jpg" alt="…" class="bento-media" />
        <p class="bento-headline">The most personal camera.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bento-card bg-blue">
        <span class="bento-stat">48 MP</span>
        <p class="bento-label">Fusion Camera</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bento-card bg-light">
        <span class="bento-stat">4K</span>
        <p class="bento-label">Cinematic video</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bento-card bento-card--wide bg-light">
        <p class="bento-headline">A17 Pro chip. A monster win for gaming.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bento-card bg-dark">
        <span class="bento-stat">3×</span>
        <p class="bento-label">Optical zoom</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css
.section-eyebrow {
  font-size: 28px;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: var(--space-xl); /* 32px below heading */
  color: var(--apple-text-dark);
}

.bento-headline {
  font-size: 21px;
  font-weight: 600;
  line-height: 1.3;
  color: inherit;
  margin: 0;
}

.bento-stat {
  font-size: 56px; /* matches iPhone LP recreation */
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1;
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: var(--space-xs); /* 4pt below stat */
}

.bento-label {
  font-size: 17px;
  color: var(--apple-text-mid);
  margin: 0;
}

.bento-media {
  width: 100%;
  height: 60%;
  object-fit: cover;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}

/* Background variants */
.bg-dark {
  background: #1d1d1f;
  color: #fff;
}
.bg-blue {
  background: #0a72e0;
  color: #fff;
}
.bg-light {
  background: var(--apple-bg-light);
  color: var(--apple-text-dark);
}
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Arbitrary spacing off the grid

Using `margin-top: 13px`, `padding: 7px 11px`, or `gap: 9px` anywhere in an Apple-style layout is a red flag. It signals that a design decision was made by eye in the moment rather than by system. These values do not survive responsive scaling, dark-mode contrast adjustments, or Dynamic Type size changes cleanly. The fix: round to the nearest 4pt or 8pt value, then verify it still reads correctly [documented].

### Ignoring safe areas

Placing tappable controls, text labels, or critical imagery in the top 62pt or bottom 34pt of an iPhone viewport without safe-area awareness means the Dynamic Island or home indicator will partially cover them on current hardware. The mistake is especially common in web/PWA contexts where `viewport-fit=cover` is set but `env(safe-area-inset-*)` is not applied [documented from real device reports]. Always pair `viewport-fit=cover` with `env()` insets.

### Sub-44pt tap targets

Interactive elements smaller than 44×44pt pass visual inspection and fail real-device usability, particularly for users with motor impairments. The visual size of a button can be smaller — Apple's own navigation bar items often appear as 20–28pt icons — but the hit area must be padded to 44pt minimum. This is testable via Xcode's Accessibility Inspector [documented].

### Cramped bento

A bento grid where tiles have interior padding below 16px, gap below 8px, or border-radius below 12px stops reading as "bento" and starts reading as a cramped table. Apple's tiles breathe: headline text sits at the bottom third of each tile with generous whitespace above it. The instinct to pack more information into each tile is the primary failure mode. One idea per tile is the rule [documented].

### Ignoring the readable content guide on iPad

Displaying text that stretches to full iPad landscape width produces lines of 130+ characters, which causes readers to lose their place between lines. The readable content guide caps this at ~87 characters. Failing to apply it (or its CSS equivalent via a `max-width` on text blocks) is the single most common iPad layout mistake [documented].

### Breaking the 980px container for text content

It is tempting to make a product page wider at 1440px or full-bleed for impact. Full-bleed works for photography and video. Text content at 1440px with no inner container becomes unreadable. Apple's own full-bleed sections always inset their text to the ~980px column width [inferred from product page analysis].

### Fixed pixel values for safe areas

Hard-coding `padding-top: 44px` or `padding-bottom: 34px` for safe areas was acceptable before iPhone X. Now it is wrong for most of the device matrix. iPhone Air's 68pt top inset is not predictable by guessing. Use `env(safe-area-inset-top)` on web and `safeAreaInsets` / `safeAreaLayoutGuide` on native [documented].

CONFIDENCE: 78% — Core iOS values (safe-area insets, 44pt tap targets, 8pt grid rationale, 980px max-width) are well-documented and cross-confirmed; apple.com's exact 2024/2026 CSS breakpoints and bento gap values lack direct devtools measurement and are inferred from recreations and community analyses. New adaptive-layout sections (size classes, clamp formulas, container queries): 82% — size class mappings and HIG navigation rules are documented; clamp coefficients are derived from the documented formula applied to reasonable min/max targets (not measured against a live Apple product); container query syntax is directly from MDN specification.
