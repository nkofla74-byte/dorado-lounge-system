# Apple Design — Foundations (color · typography · layout)

The visual fundamentals Apple builds every surface on. Depth lives in the three
reference files; this is the map + the rules you must not get wrong.

## When to use

- Picking a color palette, dark-mode strategy, or wide-gamut color.
- Setting a type scale (in-app Dynamic Type **or** apple.com marketing headlines).
- Establishing spacing, grid, safe-area, or bento layout.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Semantic over literal color.** Use system roles (`label`, `systemBackground`, `systemBlue`); never hardcode hex that can't adapt to light/dark/contrast.
- **Dark mode = dimming, not inverting.** Elevated surfaces get _lighter_, not pure-inverted. True-black only where it serves OLED.
- **System font stack.** `font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, "SF Pro", ...` — SF is **not** licensed as an arbitrary webfont; rely on the stack. Match optical size (SF Text < ~20pt, SF Display ≥ ~20pt).
- **Dynamic Type must reflow.** Layouts grow/wrap; never truncate body text at large sizes.
- **8-point grid** (4pt half-steps for tight gaps). Min **44×44pt** tap target. Respect `env(safe-area-inset-*)`.

## Common mistakes

- Hardcoded hex instead of adaptive tokens; pure inversion for dark mode.
- Wrong optical size / faux-bold; tracking too tight on body.
- Off-grid spacing; ignoring safe areas; cramped bento with no hero tile.
