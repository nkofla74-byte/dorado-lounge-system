# Apple Design — Materials & Iconography

Apple's surface character: translucent glass materials, and the icon/symbol system.

## When to use

- Building a frosted/glass panel, nav, sheet, or the Liquid Glass look.
- Designing an app icon (the squircle is **not** a plain rounded rectangle).
- Using or imitating SF Symbols.

## Core rules

- **Glass is a layer, not a paint.** It samples + blurs what's behind, then tints with vibrant labels. Web approximation: `backdrop-filter: blur() saturate()` + a translucent fill + a light top-edge highlight. CSS can't do Apple's real-time **lensing/refraction** — approximate, don't pretend.
- **Never stack glass on glass**, and never put low-contrast text on a busy translucent area. Always provide a `prefers-reduced-transparency` opaque fallback.
- **The squircle is a G2 continuous-curvature shape** (community-reverse-engineered Bézier), not `border-radius`. Use `clip-path`/SVG, or `corner-shape: squircle` (Chrome 139+, not yet Safari/Firefox).
- **SF Symbols** match font weight + optical size; pick one rendering mode (monochrome / hierarchical / palette / multicolor) deliberately. Don't multicolor everything.

## Common mistakes

- Over-blurring everything; glass-on-glass; ignoring reduce-transparency.
- Simple `border-radius` instead of continuous corners; off-grid icon art.
- Mismatched symbol weight vs adjacent text; multicolor overuse.
