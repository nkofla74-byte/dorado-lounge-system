# Apple Design — Motion (animation · gestures · feedback)

How Apple makes interfaces feel alive: spring-driven, interruptible, responsive.

## When to use

- Adding any transition, animation, gesture, or press/loading feedback.
- Making web motion feel "Apple-fluid" rather than canned-easing.

## Core rules

- **Springs over fixed easing.** Apple animates with springs (mass/stiffness/damping), parameterized as `response` + `dampingFraction` (or `duration` + `bounce`). On web, generate a CSS `linear()` curve from spring params — don't default to `ease`.
- **Interruptible + velocity handoff.** Respond on `pointerdown`, let a gesture's release velocity feed the spring, and allow mid-flight redirection. Never block input behind an animation.
- **Animate `transform`/`opacity` only** (GPU-composited); use `will-change` sparingly. Don't animate layout properties.
- **Every action gets feedback** — visual press state (scale/dim) always; haptics where available. **Web Vibration API does not work in iOS Safari** — never rely on it for tactile feel.
- **Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`**: provide a fade/instant alternative, not the big move.
- **Bind to continuous scroll progress on flagship pages.** On flagship/marketing pages, bind motion to CONTINUOUS scroll progress (damped — smooth the _read_, never hijack scroll), not just in-view reveals. Reversible, multi-rate scroll-progress motion is the single biggest differentiator between a dead template and an alive Apple page.

## Common mistakes

- `ease`/`linear` everywhere; long, non-interruptible, input-blocking animations.
- Animating `width/top/height` instead of `transform`; ignoring reduced-motion.
- No tap feedback; haptic spam / double-firing; assuming web vibration works on iOS.

This skill OWNS the reusable scroll/pointer engine primitives above. Page-level scroll _compositions_ that build on them — theme/background morph, sticky-stacked cards, scrubbed canvas hero — live in **apple-design-web**. The surface-axis decision (whether a given surface should commit to continuous motion at all) lives in **apple-design**'s `restraint-and-antislop.md`.
