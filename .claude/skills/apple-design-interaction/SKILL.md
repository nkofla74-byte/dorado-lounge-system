# Apple Design — Interaction Logic (how it behaves, not how it looks)

The **functional decision layer**: which navigation, which state behavior, how it
responds, and _why_. This is the technical/functionality half of Apple design —
what makes an interface feel right beyond how it looks. Reach here for behavior
decisions; reach for `apple-design-motion` for the animation that executes them
and `apple-design-os` for the components they configure.

## When to use

- Choosing navigation/presentation: push vs sheet vs modal vs tab vs popover vs split-view vs full-screen.
- Designing state behavior: loading/empty/error/disabled, optimistic updates, pull-to-refresh, pagination.
- Tuning perceived performance / responsiveness.
- Handling focus, keyboard, input, hit targets, pointer-vs-touch.

## Core rules

- **Match navigation to information hierarchy.** Push = drilling into a hierarchy; sheet/modal = a self-contained sub-task that returns; tab = peer top-level sections; split view = master/detail on wide screens; full-screen cover = an immersive/focused mode. Back must be obvious & predictable; **preserve and restore state** on return.
- **Respond in <100 ms, always.** Instant visual feedback on touch; **optimistic UI** for likely-success actions; spinners only for >1 s, **skeletons** for content-shaped waits. Never block input behind a spinner.
- **Design every state, not just the happy path:** loading, empty (with a path forward), error (with recovery), disabled (with a reason), success. Empty/error states are features, not afterthoughts.
- **Make targets reachable & affordant:** ≥44 pt, primary actions in the thumb zone, **visible focus**, full keyboard operability; every gesture has a visible fallback.
- **Scroll is an input — decide consciously.** Continuous scroll-progress motion (properties bound to scrollY) makes the user feel they are _driving_ the interface. **HELPS** on flagship/marketing/product/onboarding surfaces where pacing and narrative are the goal — commit fully or skip entirely; half-measures read as glitches. **HURTS** on utility/productivity surfaces (lists, dashboards, forms, settings, docs) — it slows task completion and fights muscle memory; keep scroll plain and fast there. **ABSOLUTE: never scroll-jack** (never `preventDefault` wheel/touchmove, never `overflow:hidden` fake-scroll, never page-level vertical snap). You may smooth the _read value_ via lerp; you may never seize control of the scrollbar position. Always preserve a working native scrollbar and keyboard scroll. Pointer-reactive motion (tilt, magnetic, spotlight) is `(pointer:fine)` desktop-only sugar — touch users must lose nothing. Gate all scroll-driven transforms under `prefers-reduced-motion`. → See `references/perceived-performance-and-input.md §Scroll as a continuous input/affordance` + `apple-design` → `restraint-and-antislop.md` for the surface-axis classification.

## Common mistakes

- Modal overuse (a sheet where a push belongs); unpredictable back; lost state on return.
- Spinner for everything; blocking input; no optimistic UI; janky perceived performance.
- Only the happy path — no empty/error/disabled design.
- Gesture-only actions with no fallback; unreachable primary actions; no visible focus ring.
