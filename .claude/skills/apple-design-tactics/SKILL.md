# Apple Design — Tactics (accessibility · marketing & brand)

Two cross-cutting human-factors lenses: designing for _everyone_, and persuading like Apple.

## When to use

- Meeting Apple's accessibility bar, or understanding _why_ a11y constraints shape Apple's whole design language.
- Writing/structuring premium marketing — copy voice, pricing, photography, page narrative.

## Core rules — accessibility

- **Accessibility is the default, not a retrofit** (the curb-cut effect: edge cases help everyone). Many Apple rules _exist because of_ a11y: Dynamic Type → reflow layouts; Reduce Transparency → opaque material fallbacks; Reduce Motion → fade alternatives.
- **POUR / WCAG 2.2 AA**: semantic HTML + ARIA, accessible names, **never color alone**, 4.5:1 text contrast, visible `:focus-visible` ring, manage focus, respect `prefers-reduced-motion` / `prefers-contrast` / `prefers-reduced-transparency`.

## Core rules — marketing & brand

- **Feeling before feature, then features as proof.** One idea per section; restraint and whitespace signal premium.
- **Product as hero** on seamless white/black with soft shadow + subtle glow; quiet, monochrome brand.
- **Copy voice:** short, confident, benefit-led, Title Case headlines, concrete numbers ("The most powerful iPhone ever."). Pricing leads premium → anchors → monthly framing.

## Common mistakes

- Color-only meaning, fixed font sizes, motion with no opt-out, opaque-only-on-blur text, missing labels/focus.
- Feature-dumping, hype without proof, weak whitespace, inconsistent voice, fake scarcity, busy hero shots, hidden monthly price, competing CTAs.
